Deleting metadata
#################

A user should have modify privileges on a metadata to be able to remove it.

There are two ways to remove metadata. In the search result select the metadata record and select 'remove' in the 'actions on selection'. Or in the 'contribute' section click the remove button of the record. 

Note, that if a metadata originates from a harvester, that metadata will automatically be removed when the metadata in the harvested system is removed or the harvester itself is removed.
