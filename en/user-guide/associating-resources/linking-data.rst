Online Resources
````````````````

A linked data is represented as an online resource in the metadata.
Here an example::

     <gmd:onLine xmlns:fra="http://www.cnig.gouv.fr/2005/fra"
                 xmlns:gmi="http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmi">
        <gmd:CI_OnlineResource>
           <gmd:linkage>
              <gmd:URL>https://download.data.grandlyon.com/wms/grandlyon</gmd:URL>
           </gmd:linkage>
           <gmd:protocol>
              <gco:CharacterString>OGC:WMS</gco:CharacterString>
           </gmd:protocol>
           <gmd:name>
              <gco:CharacterString>cad_cadastre.cadsubdivisionsection</gco:CharacterString>
           </gmd:name>
           <gmd:description>
              <gco:CharacterString>Subdivision de section cadastrale (Plan cadastral informatis√© du Grand Lyon)(OGC:WMS)</gco:CharacterString>
           </gmd:description>
        </gmd:CI_OnlineResource>
     </gmd:onLine>

To add a new one, click on the + caret button then `Add online resource` button or, if alreay one exists, just click on the title of the `Online resources section`.

If you want to add a WMS resource, the wizzard can show you a list of layers to add after you set the protocol to `OGC:WMS*` and set your WMS service url.
You can then pick a layer in the list to add the resource to the metadata.
