Tagging with categories
#######################

Each GeoNetwork site has a set of local categories that can be used to classify metadata records for easy searching. To assign categories to a metadata record, follow these steps:

- Find your metadata record using the search option. Whether you have just one or many results from your search, you will always see a row of buttons including a **Categories** button.

- Click on the **Categories** button. A drop down menu will appear from which you can assign one or more categories using checkboxes. Simply click on the small box next to the category to place or remove a checkmark.
