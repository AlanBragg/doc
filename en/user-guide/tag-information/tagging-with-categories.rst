Tagging with categories
#######################

A catalog can define a set of categories that can be used to classify
metadata records for easy searching or managment purposes (see :ref:`managing-categories`).
Categories will not be added to the metadata records itself and as such may not be
exported when the record is harvested (eg. when using CSW protocol).
If the category needs to be propagated with the metadata, use other
harvesting protocols (eg. GeoNetwork) or use keywords (see :ref:`tagging-with-keywords`).


To assign categories to a metadata record, 2 ways of doing it are privided:

- Search the metadata record, select one or more record and choose
  the ``Ã™pdate categories`` on the selection

- Search the metadata record, open the editor and click on the ``Categories`` button.
  A drop down menu will appear from which you can assign one or more categories
  using checkboxes
